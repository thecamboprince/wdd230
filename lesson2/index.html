            between different contents. From the top to the bottom is mostly white space with little wordings, which makes it pop out and straight to point of what

            together as a cohesive whole. This type of algorithsm can help users navigate through contents of the same kind. So that this way, it keeps the users/watchers stay on 
            their website for a longer period of time.
